/*
JAVASCRIPT:
    Javascript is a high-level, 
    Prototype-based object oriented,
    Multi-paradigm (an approach and mindset of structing code, style and technique),
    Interpreted or Just in compile,
    Dynamic, 
    Single Threaded, 
    Garbage Collected,
    First Class function, 
    Event Loop Concurrency Model, JS Engine runs single thread at a time
                             But, Using EVENT LOOP, multiple tasks can executed 



    Execution Context, in which peice of JS code is executed.
    
                    Creation of Global Execution Context(not insides functions)
                                             ğŸ‘‡
                    Execution of top-level code(inside global Execution Context)

                    Execution of Functions and waiting for Callbacks
