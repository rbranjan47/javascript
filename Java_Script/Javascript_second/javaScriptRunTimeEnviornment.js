// JavaScript ---> Js Engines ---> API ---> Call Back Queue ---> Micro Task Queue ---> Event Loop ---> Code Executes
// but whole Js Engine  ---Comes under --> Browser

//Example: Node.js  ---> Also had run time environment(means it can run javascript code using its JRE)
//Chrome ---> v8(in c++)
//Edge ---> Chakra
//FIrefox ---> Spider Monkey(in c, c++)

//Code ---> Parsing ---> Compilation ---> Execution

//JIT --> Just In Time Compilation
//
//Interpreter --> Code executes line by line, doesn't care what come next
//Complier --> Code Compile into low level lang. & then executor

//In Interpreter --> Compiles fast But Compiler more efficiency

//But JavaScript --> Both Interpreted & Compiled lang., depends upon JS Engine
